      <p class="intro__title">What we haven't seen there?</p>
      <p class="intro__text">According to All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion polls, 95% of Russians dream of 
        going somewhere, but only 36% plan to spend their holidays in their home country. Like, what have we not seen here
        at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the south, the dense forests of the Sayans and 
        the harsh ice of the Putorana Plateau. And you can also see all these beauties without millions in your account, 
        a passport and many hours of flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova, a brave young mother who took three children
        in her arms and sat them in her "Lada" and drove 20 thousand kilometers in her native country. We have selected and
        described some interesting places, worthy of your vacation.</p>

            and the German heritage of a scattering of small seaside towns. The atmosphere of these places eliminates the fuss, dipping
            in the tranquility of nature and the smell of steel, cool sea.</p>

            seeing the northern lights comes true with a ticket to Murmansk.</p>

          <p class="place__paragraph">Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. First of all, because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will see
            slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open the windows in your car, you can
            get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places - mountain air.</p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is temperate, so it is best to go here in summer. So you will see all the diversity of the local
            flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. AND
            famous manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.</p>

          <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, it's all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place for
            skiing competitions. This is a sport where the skier ties himself
            to the motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019 at the festival
            "Baikal Mile" was set a world record - 122.417 mi / h.</p>

             not grow west of the Vodlozero. But here it swings up to 30 meters - the forests of the Karelian national parks, 
             due to impenetrable swamps, have never known an ax. Some pines are more than half a millennium old. Touch a living
             creature that saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it. In the virgin forest for a hundred kilometers you will not 
             find a path. And on rare trails, trees a couple of meters from the ground are marked with bear claws. Let everyone 
             know who's in charge here.</p>
